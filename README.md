## Machine Learning in Python - Notes

# Needed packages:
+ pandas: to read data properly (using DataFrames), calculate basic stadistics, and run basic operations with data. 
+ NumPy: equivalent to Matlab in Python. Use N-dimensional arrays, operate with them, linear algebra, fourier, etc. (Also has the option to create dummy datasets)
+ matplotlib: Python 2D plotting library.
+ IPython: Python IDE/Notebook which can be used in browser. It allows to load media, plots, etc.
+ Scikit-Learn: library to create predictive models. It's based in pandas, NumPy and matplotlib.

# Recommended IDEs
+ IDLE: only for Python
+ IPython/Jupyter Notebook
+ Spyder

# 5 stages in Data Science:
1. Describe the problem/Ask the right questions: Which is the company objective? What do we want to predict?
2. Obtain and prepare the data: How can we obtain the data? Which information is relevant? Clean and filter the data to later analyze it
3. Explore the data: Visualize the data/ Locate in the graphics possible trends, correlations or patterns.
4. Modeling and evaluating the data: Use the correct algorithm (depending on the problem) to create the model/Evaluate the model
5. Communicate the results and apply them: Which results have we obtained? What have we learned? Have the results sense?

# Data Science facts
We can divide the data analysis in two different view points:
+ Retrospective analysis
+ Predictive analysis

We also can divide the stadistical algorithms in:
+ Supervised algorithms
+ Unsupervised algorithms
